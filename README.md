zmbackup
=========

zmbackup is a fork from Zmbkpose, a Bash shell script created to suppress the need for backup in Zimbra Collaboration Suite Opensource. As the project is dead, with no update or correction, I took the code, made the necessary corrections to work again and include new functions that was missing. So zmbackup is entirelly compatible with zmbkpose, just changing the binary and is ready to go!
